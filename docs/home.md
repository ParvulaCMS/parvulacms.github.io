# What is Parvula

Parvula is a simple (but powerful!) content management system written in PHP.

# Why Parvula ?

Parvula wants to stay **simple** but also **flexible**. Plenty of CMS's already exist in the wild but we wanted to have, at least, a CMS which is :

 - Free and open source
 - Flexible (can be customized and extended easily)
 - Simple and intuitive (comprehensible functions and variable names, straightforward documentation)
