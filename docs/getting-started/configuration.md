Parvula has three default configuration files in the `data/config` folder.

 - `site.yaml` for the public website information
 - `system.yaml` for the core of Parvula
 - `mappers.yaml` to setup the "database" connections

## Site configuration

 - `title` The site title
 - `description` The site description
 - `theme` Theme to use (should be located in `themes/`)
 - `homePage` Default page to load (when url is `mysite.com`)

## System configuration

To do some fine tuning. See the comments of the files for more details.

## Mappers configuration

Useful if you want to add a new mapper, for advanced users.
